<h4>
    Coffee on the Crescent
</h4>
<p>
    This delightful spot belongs to ex-professional cricketer Tim Linley and unfolds a captivating tale. 
    Tim's passion for coffee resonates in each carefully brewed cup, yet it transcends beyond coffee; 
    it's a celebration of community. The cafe champions local artisans with a thoughtfully curated array of art and gifts, 
    actively engages in supporting food banks, and spearheads an initiative to revive a neglected section of Woodhouse Moor. 
    These are just a few avenues through which this Leeds cafe makes a positive impact. 
    Come for the philosophy, linger for the exceptional coffee.

<h5>What I like it about it</h5>
<p>
    A matcha latte is one of my favourite drinks, 
    and they source it directly from Japan; 
    it's incredibly tasty. Additionally, they offer oat milk at the shop. 
    The ice cream is exceptionally creamy and delicious. 
    I have a particular fondness for the brownies, especially the salty caramel flavour!

                  <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                  <p>
                    I love cakes for their delicious flavours, 
                    especially the Lemon Curd Loaf Cake. 
                    Macarons are like tiny bursts of joy with their delicate shells and sweet fillings. 
                    Afternoon tea is a delightful ritual, sipping on tea, 
                    enjoying sandwiches, and indulging in sweet pastries - it's a simple joy that makes any day special. 
                    I adore the beautiful tea room ambiance that adds to the charm. 
                    It's not just about the delightful treats; it's also the comfort and warmth that make the experience truly special.
