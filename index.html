        <h4>Coffee on the Crescent</h4>
        <p>
        Owned by former professional cricketer Tim Linley, 
        this charming spot tells a captivating tale. 
        Tim's love for coffee is evident in each meticulously brewed cup, 
        yet it goes beyond coffee; it's a celebration of community. 
        The cafe actively supports local artisans, contributes to food banks, 
        and leads an initiative to revive a neglected section of Woodhouse Moor.
        </p>
        <h5>Address:</h5>
        <p>2 The Crescent, Hyde Park, Leeds, LS6 2NW</p>
        <h5>What I like about it</h5>
        <p>
            A matcha latte is one of my favourite drinks, 
            and they source it directly from Japan; it's incredibly tasty. 
            Additionally, they offer oat milk at the shop. 
            The ice cream is exceptionally creamy and delicious. 
            I have a particular fondness for the brownies, 
            especially the salty caramel flavour!

            I love cakes, especially the Lemon Curd Loaf Cake, for their delicious flavours. 
            Macarons are like tiny bursts of joy with delicate shells and sweet fillings. 
            Afternoon tea, with its delightful ritual of sipping tea, enjoying sandwiches, 
            and indulging in sweet pastries, brings simple joy to any day. 
            The beautiful tea room ambiance adds to the charm, making the experience truly special with comfort and warmth.

            At La Bottega Milanese, it's not just about coffee; they have delicious cakes and genuine Italian food.

        <h5>What I like about it</h5>
        <p>
            This café is just a short walk from Leeds Art Gallery. 
            I really liked the design with white-painted brick, light bulbs, and wood, 
            giving it a cool industrial style. There's also a terrace outside the front door. 
            They serve matcha lattes and lots of yummy cakes.
